						We provide two course trial alternatives to students who are
						interested in enrolling with TathaGat. A student may sign up for a
						15-day course trial OR a demo class. A student may take the 15-day
						trial course, once he/she has enrolled by paying the fee as per the
						offered plan. The 15-day trial period is subject to the fee refund
						policy. If, over the course of 15- day trial—during which there will
						be at least 4–5 classes—a student experiences any problems, or, for
						any reason, decides against continuing with the enrolment, an
						unconditional fee refund will be provided. The students who sign up
						for the demo class will not be entitled to a fee refund. Also, any
						student who has been offered a fee rebate for any reasons shall not
						be eligible for any refund. This refund policy is applicable to all
						Fee for Self paid Students and Sponsored students who have paid Full
						Fee / Partial Fee.
